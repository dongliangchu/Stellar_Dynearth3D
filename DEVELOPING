=============================================================================

To-do list:

High priority:
* Simple benchmarks for rheology
* Advanced Interpolation
* Pressure regularization

Low priority:
* Restart
* Save output as vtk format directly
* Stress BC, esp no-stress sidewall
* Heatflux BC
* Frictional heating
* Adiabatic cooling (adiabatic temperature profile)
* Internal heating
* Volume changed induced stress
* Initial weak zone location & geometry


=============================================================================

Design notes:

* Avoid C++ stream for bulk ouput, as stream is slower than C-style IO.
* Avoid creating/destroying objects in inner for-loops.
* Avoid static variables and global variables.
* Meaning of error codes:
   1: User input error
   2: IO error
  10: Triangulation/tetrahedralization error
  11: Runtime error
  12: Assertion error (due to programming)
